        <p>
            By default NLPCraft uses <a target=_ href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Apache Ignite</a> project as its
            underlying in-memory distributed storage and cluster computing framework. If running with Apache Ignite 2.7 or
            earlier on Java 9/10/11 you need to follow these
            <a target=_ href="https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/getting-started#section-running-ignite-with-java-9-10-11">instructions.</a>
            For Java 8 no additional parameters are required.
