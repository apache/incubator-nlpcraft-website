        <p>
            For releases marked with <i class="fas fa-fw fa-bomb"></i> you need to reset the existing database. If you are
            using the Apache Ignite storage (default configuration for NLPCraft) you can accomplish this by
            removing <code>${USER_HOME}/.nlpcraft/ignite</code> folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are using other storage engines (e.g. Postgres or MySQL) you need to follow their specific
            procedures to recreate the database using SQL scripts from <code>sql</code> sub-folder in NLPCraft
            installation directory.

    <section id="config">
        <h2 class="section-title">External Configuration <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            Due to <a target="asf" href="https://apache.org/legal/release-policy.html">Apache release policy</a> the official Apache release cannot include content that is based on
            <a target=_ href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Commons Attribution 4.0 International</a> (CC BY 4.0) license
            or any binary artifacts regardless of their respective licences. Due to these restrictions the official Apache NLPCraft release
            does not include certain configuration files that are necessary for its operation. These files will be auto-downloaded upon first star of NLPCraft (hence the internet
            connection is required for the first start).
            On subsequent starts the NLPCraft will check for the updates and will re-download these files only if they were changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, this external configuration is hosted on GitHub (in <code>external_config</code> branch of NLPCraft project) from where it will
            be automatically downloaded on the first start: <a target="github" href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-nlpcraft/raw/external_config/external">https://github.com/apache/incubator-nlpcraft/raw/external_config/external</a>.
            You can change this location, e.g. move the external configuration behind your firewall or onto your local file system,
            as well as change other parameters related to auto-download of the external <a href="/server-and-probe.html#config">configuration</a>
            in <code>*.conf</code> file (see <code>nlpcraft.extConfig</code> property).

        <p>
            Starting with NLPCraft 0.7.0, NLPCraft requires JDK 11 as its minimum JDK version.
            NLPCraft uses <a target=_ href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Apache Ignite 2.x</a> project as its
            underlying in-memory distributed storage and cluster computing framework. When running Apache Ignite 2.x
            on Java 11 you need to follow these
            <a target=_ href="https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/getting-started#section-running-ignite-with-java-9-10-11">instructions</a> which
            are automatically followed when you use <a href="/tools/script.html"><code>nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code></a> script.
