        <p>
            NLPCraft is based on three main concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                {% scaladoc NCModel NCModel %} is a user-configured object responsible for input interpretation.
            </li>
            <li>
                {% scaladoc NCPipeline NCPipeline %} is a part of the model configuration that defines
                specifics of the user input processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                {% scaladoc NCModelClient NCModelClient %} is responsible for communication with the data model.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here's the typical code structure when working with NLPCraft:</p>

        <pre class="brush: scala, highlight: []">
              // Init data model.
              val mdl = new CustomNlpModel()

              // Creates client for given model.
              val cli = new NCModelClient(mdl)

              // Sends text request to model by user ID "user01".
              val result = client.ask("Some user command", "user01")
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="terminology">
        <h2 class="section-title">Terminology<a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            Let's start with the nomenclature of the main NLPCraft types:
        </p>

        <table class="gradient-table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><b>{% scaladoc NCModel NCModel %}</b></td>
                <td>
                    <code>Model</code> is the main component in NLPCraft. User-define data model contains its {% scaladoc NCModelConfig NCModelConfig %},
                    input processing {% scaladoc NCPipeline NCPipeline %} and life-cycle callbacks.
                    NLPCraft employs model-as-a-code approach where entire data model is an implementation of just
                    this interface. The instance of this interface is passed to {% scaladoc NCModelClient NCModelClient %} class.
                    Note that the model-as-a-code approach natively supports any software life cycle tools and frameworks
                    like various build tools, CI/SCM tools, IDEs, etc. You don't need any additional tools to manage some
                    aspects of your data models - your entire model and all of its components are part of your project's source code.
                    Note that in most cases, one would use a convenient {% scaladoc NCModelAdapter NCModelAdapter %} adapter to implement this interface.

                    <code>Token</code> is simple string, part of user input, which is obtained by splitting user input
                    according to some rules. For example, the user input "<b>Where is it?</b>" contains four tokens:
                    "<code>Where</code>", "<code>is</code>", "<code>it</code>", "<code>?</code>".
                    Usually <code>tokens</code> are words and punctuation symbols which also contain additional
                    information like point of speech tags, relative position in the overall input text, stopword flag,
                    stem and lemma forms, etc. List of parsed <code>tokens</code> serves as an input for parsing <code>entities</code>.

                    or product that can often be denoted with a proper name. It can be abstract or have a physical existence.
                    Each <code>entity</code> consists of zero or more <code>tokens</code>. Combination of entities form one or more parsing
                    <code>variants</code>.

                    interpretations of the original sequence of tokens. Each such interpretation is defined as a parsing <code>variant</code>.
                    For example, user input <b>"Look at this crane."</b> can be interpreted as two <code>variants</code>,

                    <code>Intent</code> is user defined callback method and rule according to which this callback should be called.
                    Most often rule is some template based on expected set of <code>entities</code> in user input,
                    but it can be defined more flexible.
                    Parameters extracted from user text input are passed into callback method.
                    This method execution result is provided to user as answer on his request.
                    <code>Intent</code> callbacks are methods defined in <code>Data Model</code> class annotated by

                    IDL, Intent Definition Language, is a relatively straightforward declarative language which
                    defines a match between the parsed user input represented as the collection of tokens,
                    and the user-define callback method.
                    IDL intents are bound to their callbacks via Java annotation and can be located
                    in the same Java annotations or placed in model YAML/JSON file as well as in external *.idl files.

                    IDL matched terms.

        <p>
            So, <code>Data Model</code> must be able to do tree following things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Parse user input text as the <code>tokens</code>.
                They are input for searching <code>named entities</code>.
                <code>Tokens</code> parsing components should be included into <a href="#model-pipeline">Model pipeline</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find <code>named entities</code> based on these parsed <code>tokens</code>.
                They are input for searching <code>intents</code>.
                <code>Entity</code> parsing components should be included into <a href="#model-pipeline">Model pipeline</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare <code>intents</code> with their callbacks methods which contain business logic.
                These methods should be defined directly in the model class definition or the model should have references on them.
                It will be described below. Callback can de defined in model scala class directly or via references.
                Look at the chapter <a href="intent-matching.html">Intent Matching</a> content for get more details.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As example, let's prepare the system which can call persons from your contact list.
            Typical commands are: "<b>Please call to John Smith</b>" or "<b>Connect me with Barbara Dillan</b>".
            For solving this task this model should be able to recognize in user text following entities:
            <code>command</code> and <code>person</code> to apply this command.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, when request "<b>Please call to John Smith</b>" received, our model should be able to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Parse tokens splitting user text input:
                "<code>please</code>", "<code>call</code>", "<code>to</code>", "<code>john</code>", "<code>smith</code>".
            </li>
            <li>
                Find two named entities:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>command</code> by token "<code>call</code>".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>person</code> by tokens "<code>john</code>" and "<code>smith</code>".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Have prepared intent:
                <pre class="brush: scala, highlight: [1, 2, 5, 6]">
                    @NCIntent("intent=call term(command)={# == 'command'} term(person)={# == 'person'}")
                    def onCommand(
                        ctx: NCContext,
                        im: NCIntentMatch,
                        @NCIntentTerm("command") command: NCEntity,
                        @NCIntentTerm("person") person: NCEntity
                    ): NCResult = ? // Implement business logic here.
                </pre>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>Line 1</code> defines intent <code>call</code> with two conditions
                        which expects two named entities in user input text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Line 2</code> defines related callback method <code>onCommand()</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Lines 4 and 5</code> define two callback method's arguments which are corresponded to
                        <code>call</code> intent terms conditions. You can extract normalized value
                        <code>john smith</code> from the <code>person</code> parameter and use it in the method body
                        for getting his phone number etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
