        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script is a <b>central management utility</b> for NLPCraft that supports
            REPL (interactive) and command line modes. Most of the functions this script does can be done through running
            Java applications or using REST API - yet using this script you can perform the same tasks much simpler and quicker.
            From starting and managing REST server and probes, running various built-in tools, to testing models via REST API -
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script provides a single centralized utility that makes a quick work out
            of all these routine tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The script is only available in either official Apache <a href="/download.html#src">source ZIP</a> or in
            <a href="/download.html#zip">binary ZIP</a> distributions. If you used Maven or similar build tools to
            add NLPCraft to your project as a dependency, this script will not be available out-of-the-box - you will
            need to download ZIP distribution separately.
        </p>
        <div class="bq warn">
            <b>ZIP Distribution</b>
            <p>
                The <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script is only available in <a href="/download.html">ZIP distributions</a>. For Maven/Gradle/SBT
                projects you will need to download <a href="/download.html">ZIP distribution</a> separately.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The script is located in <code>/bin</code> sub-folder of the installation root and is available for
            Unix/Linux (<code>nlpcraft.sh</code>) and Windows (<code>nlpcraft.cmd</code>) environments. Both versions
            provide identical functionality.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Quick Start</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> works in two modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Command line mode where it executes a single command at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interactive REPL mode. To enter REPL mode run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh</code> without any arguments.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All the functionality and command syntax remain the same regardless of whether a command is executed from a command line or
            in REPL mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh</code> without any arguments:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli1.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Script starts in the REPL mode by default. Note that in REPL mode the command prompt always shows REST
            server status, local probe status, REST access token (if any) as well as current working directory.
        </p>
        <div class="bq info">
            <b>REPL Prompt</b>
            <p>
                REPL prompt shows 4 pieces of information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>REST server status (<code>ON</code> if server is started and detected, <code>OFF</code> otherwise).</li>
                <li>Local probe status (<code>ON</code> if probe is started and connected to the server, <code>OFF</code> otherwise).</li>
                <li>REST access token if the user is signed in. This token is required for all REST calls.</li>
                <li>Current user working directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note that when using <code>start-server</code> command the default user account is automatically signed in
                upon server start and the access token is obtained. You can sign in with different user account, if necessary.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Get Command List</h2>
        <p>
            Type <code>help</code> to list all supported commands (or run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh help</code> if in command line mode):
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli2.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get detailed instructions and usage examples for any command
            <code>xxx</code> by typing <code>help --cmd=xxx</code>, for example:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" alt="" src="/images/cli7.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            Use <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> key anytime for command auto-suggestion and auto-completion.<br/>
            Use <span class="keyboard">↑</span> and <span class="keyboard">↓</span> keys to scroll through command history.
        </p>
        <p>
            To exit <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script in REPL mode type <code>quit</code>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="os_commands">
        <h2 class="section-title">OS Commands</h2>
        <p>
            You can run any external OS-specific commands from <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script by prepending such
            command with a <code>$</code> symbol. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            > $git pull
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Runs <code>git pull</code> command in the current directory.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            > $mvn clean package
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Runs Maven build in the current directory.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            > $cmd /c dir
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Runs Windows <code>dir</code> command in the current directory using a separate shell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that <em>stdin</em>, <em>stderr</em> and <em>stdout</em> of the new process will inherit from running <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script process.
            Running OS commands makes the most sense in REPL mode where you don't want to lose a session context while
            executing external OS commands. Technically, however, external OS commands can be executed from command line mode
            as well.
        </p>

    <section id="tips">
        <h2 class="tips">Tips <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Tricks</h2>
        <p>
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> is standard command line utility that can be used in the familiar ways both in
            Linux/Unix and Window environments. Note that only Windows 10 has been tested.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Using <code>start-server</code> Command</h2>
        <p>
            REST server is a fire-and-forget component in NLPCraft. You can start it once and you only need to restart it
            if you change the server configuration. It is customary to add <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd} start-server</code>
            call to the OS init script to have it started automatically on boot up.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Using Default <code>nlpcraft.conf</code></h2>
        <p>
            It is recommended to modify the standard <code>nlpcraft.conf</code> configuration file (i.e. <em>in a standard
            installation location</em>). Commands like <code>start-server</code>, <code>start-probe</code> and
            <code>test-model</code> use this default location by default and you will not have to specify alternative
            location or provide other overrides every time you run these commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you keep all your configuration modifications in the standard <code>nlpcraft.conf</code> file you can simply
            run these commands without any additional arguments - significantly simplifying their usage.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Using <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> In Scripts</h2>
        <p>
            All of the commands that utilize REST API produce JSON responses. You can easily parse these JSON responses
            for your own needs in your scripts. For example, here's the code to get the access token from the <code>signin</code>
            command (on Linux):
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: bash">
            $ bin/nlpcraft.sh no-ansi no-logo signin --email=admin@admin.com --passwd=admin | tail -n +2 | jq -M '.acsTok' | tr -d '"'
            kkoXBAn8yruEzXrj8Kja5
        </pre>
        <p>
            <b>NOTES:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We use <code>no-ansi</code> and <code>no-logo</code> special commands that clean up and simplify the
                output so that it would be easier to parse the resulting JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
                We use <code>tail -n +2</code> to skip the 1st line of the output that contains HTTP return code.
            </li>
            <li>
                We use <a target=_blank href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> utility to parse JSON inline to extract
                <code>acsTok</code> field.
            </li>
            <li>
                We use <code>tr -d '"'</code> to remove surrounding double quotes to get out final result.
            </li>
        </ul>
