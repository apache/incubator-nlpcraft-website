            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script that is a <b>central management utility</b> for NLPCraft. Most
            of the functions this script does can be done through running
            Java applications - yet, using this script, you can accomplish the same things much simpler and quicker.
            From starting and managing REST server, running various tools, to testing models via REST API -
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script provides a single centralized utility that makes a quick work out
            of all these routine tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The script is only available in either official Apache <a href="/download.html#src">source ZIP</a> or in
            <a href="/download.html#zip">binary ZIP</a> distributions. If you used Maven or similar build tools to
            add NLPCraft to your project, this script will not available automatically - you will need to download ZIP
            distribution separately.
        </p>
        <div class="bq warn">
            <b>ZIP Distribution</b>
            <p>
                The <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script is only available in <a href="/download.html">ZIP distributions</a>. For Maven/Gradle/SBT
                projects you will need to download <a href="/download.html">ZIP distribution</a> separately.

        <p>
            The script is located in <code>/bin</code> sub-folder of the installation root and is available for
            Unix/Linux (<code>nlpcraft.sh</code>) and Windows (<code>nlpcraft.cmd</code>) environments. We will use
            <code>.sh</code> version for the rest of instructions unless specified otherwise.

        <h2 class="section-title">Quick Start</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script can work in two modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Command line mode where it executes a single given command at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interactive REPL mode. To enter REPL mode run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh</code> without any arguments.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All the functionality remains the same regardless of whether each command is executed separately or
            interactively in REPL mode. To get started, run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh</code> without any arguments:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli1.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Script starts in the REPL mode by default. You can use <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> key anytime for auto-suggestion and auto-completion
            while in REPL mode. Type <code>help</code> to list of all supported commands:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli2.png" alt="">
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="usage">
        <h2 class="section-title">Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Commands supported by the <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script fall into 4 categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Server Commands.</b><br/>
                <p>
                    Server commands allow to manage locally run REST server. Note that these commands only work for the REST
                    server that runs on the same host as script. In other words, these commands cannot manage the remote REST
                    server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    REST server is a "fire-and-forget" component. During model development you will likely start the
                    server only once and check its output from time to time as most of the work will be happening in the data probe
                    that hosts your models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, <code>start-server</code> command provide the easiest and quickest way to start the REST server (with
                    default configuration by default):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="" src="/images/cli3.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that when <code>start-server</code> commands completes it shows all connected probes (none in this example)
                    and automatically signs in with the default <code>admin@admin.com</code> user account so that you can proceed
                    to testing and working with your model right away.
                </p>

                    <b>REPL Prompt</b>
                    <p>
                        REPL prompt shows 3 pieces of information:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>REST server status (<code>ON</code> if server is started and detected, <code>OFF</code> otherwise).</li>
                        <li>REST access token if the user is signed in. This token is required for all REST calls.</li>
                        <li>Current user working directory.</li>
                    </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>REPL Commands:</b>
                <p>
                    REPL commands are set of utilities that you can use while in REPL mode. Although all of these commands, as always,
                    can be executed in the command like mode - they make most sense in REPL mode (except for <code>help</code> command). When running <code>help</code>
                    command the list of REPL commands is available under <b>REPL Commands</b> heading.
                </p>
