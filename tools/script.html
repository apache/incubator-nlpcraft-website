        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script is a <b>central management utility</b> for NLPCraft that supports
            REPL (interactive) and command line modes. Most of the functions this script does can be done through running
            Java applications or using REST API - yet using this script you can perform the same tasks much simpler and quicker.
            From starting and managing REST server and probes, running various built-in tools, to testing models via REST API -
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script provides a single centralized utility that makes a quick work out
            of all these routine tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The script is only available in either official Apache <a href="/download.html#src">source ZIP</a> or in
            <a href="/download.html#zip">binary ZIP</a> distributions. If you used Maven or similar build tools to
            add NLPCraft to your project as a dependency, this script will not be available out-of-the-box - you will
            need to download ZIP distribution separately.
        </p>
        <div class="bq warn">
            <b>ZIP Distribution</b>
            <p>
                The <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script is only available in <a href="/download.html">ZIP distributions</a>. For Maven/Gradle/SBT
                projects you will need to download <a href="/download.html">ZIP distribution</a> separately.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The script is located in <code>/bin</code> sub-folder of the installation root and is available for
            Unix/Linux (<code>nlpcraft.sh</code>) and Windows (<code>nlpcraft.cmd</code>) environments. Both versions
            provide identical functionality.
        </p>

    <section id="quick_start">
        <h2 class="section-title">Quick Start</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> works in two modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Command line mode where it executes a single command at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interactive REPL mode. To enter REPL mode run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh</code> without any arguments.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All the functionality and command syntax remain the same regardless of whether a command is executed from a command line or
            in REPL mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh</code> without any arguments:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli1.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Script starts in the REPL mode by default. Note that in REPL mode the command prompt always shows REST
            server status, local probe status, REST access token (if any) as well as current working directory.
        </p>
        <div class="bq info">
            <b>REPL Prompt</b>
            <p>
                REPL prompt shows 4 pieces of information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>REST server status (<code>ON</code> if server is started and detected, <code>OFF</code> otherwise).</li>
                <li>Local probe status (<code>ON</code> if probe is started and connected to the server, <code>OFF</code> otherwise).</li>
                <li>REST access token if the user is signed in. This token is required for all REST calls.</li>
                <li>Current user working directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note that when using <code>start-server</code> command the default user account is automatically signed in
                upon server start and the access token is obtained. You can sign in with different user account, if necessary.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Get Command List</h2>
        <p>
            Type <code>help</code> to list all supported commands (or run <code>bin/nlpcraft.sh help</code> if in command line mode):
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli2.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get detailed instructions and usage examples for any command
            <code>xxx</code> by typing <code>help --cmd=xxx</code>, for example:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="non-fluid-img" alt="" src="/images/cli7.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            Use <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> key anytime for command auto-suggestion and auto-completion.<br/>
            Use <span class="keyboard">↑</span> and <span class="keyboard">↓</span> keys to scroll through command history.
        </p>
        <p>
            To exit <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script in REPL mode type <code>quit</code>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="os_commands">
        <h2 class="section-title">OS Commands</h2>
        <p>
            You can run any external OS-specific commands from <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script by prepending such
            command with a <code>$</code> symbol. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            > $git pull
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Runs <code>git pull</code> command in the current directory.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            > $mvn clean package
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Runs Maven build in the current directory.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            > $cmd /c dir
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            Runs Windows <code>dir</code> command in the current directory using a separate shell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that <em>stdin</em>, <em>stderr</em> and <em>stdout</em> of the new process will inherit from running <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script process.
            Running OS commands makes the most sense in REPL mode where you don't want to lose a session context while
            executing external OS commands. Technically, however, external OS commands can be executed from command line mode
            as well.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="usage">
        <h2 class="section-title">Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Commands supported by the <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script fall into 4 categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Server Commands.</b><br/>
                <p>
                    Server commands allow to manage locally run REST server. Note that these commands only work for the REST
                    server that runs on the same host as script. In other words, these commands cannot manage the remote REST
                    server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    REST server is a "fire-and-forget" component. During model development you will likely start the
                    server only once and check its output from time to time as most of the work will be happening in the data probe
                    that hosts your models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, <code>start-server</code> command provide the easiest and quickest way to start the REST server (with
                    default configuration by default):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="non-fluid-img" alt="" src="/images/cli3.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that when <code>start-server</code> commands completes it shows all connected probes (none in this example)
                    and automatically signs in with the default <code>admin@admin.com</code> user account so that you can proceed
                    to testing and working with your model right away.
                </p>

                    <b>REPL Prompt</b>
                    <p>
                        REPL prompt shows 3 pieces of information:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>REST server status (<code>ON</code> if server is started and detected, <code>OFF</code> otherwise).</li>
                        <li>REST access token if the user is signed in. This token is required for all REST calls.</li>
                        <li>Current user working directory.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>REST Commands:</b>
                <p>
                    All REST commands provide convenient wrappers for <a href="/using-rest.html">REST API</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tha two main commands are <code>call</code> and <code>rest</code> - they provide generic REST call wrapper
                    for both REPL and command line modes respectively. <code>call</code> command is convenient for the REPL
                    mode, while <code>rest</code> command is more convenient for the command line mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following additional commands provide custom wrappers for frequently used REST APIs:
                </p>

                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><code>ask</code></td>

                        <tr>
                            <td><code>signin</code></td>
                            <td><code>/signin</code></td>
                            <td><code>help --cmd=signin</code></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><code>signout</code></td>
                            <td><code>/signout</code></td>
                            <td><code>help --cmd=signout</code></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><code>sugsyn</code></td>

                            <td><code>help --cmd=sugsyn</code></td>
                        </tr>
                    <tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    This is an example of the session where <code>call</code> command was used to issue REST <code>/signin</code>
                    call and then REST <code>/signout</code> call:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli4.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exactly the same sequence of calls can be performed quicker and easier using convenient
                    <code>signing</code> and <code>signout</code> command wrappers:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="non-fluid-img" src="/images/cli5.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that for <code>signout</code> command you don't even have to specify the access token
                    as it is taken from the current server context automatically.
                </p>

                <b>REPL Commands:</b>
                <p>
                    REPL commands are set of utilities that you can use while in REPL mode. Although all of these commands, as always,
                    can be executed in the command like mode - they make most sense in REPL mode (except for <code>help</code> command).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Miscellaneous Tools:</b>
                <p>
                    Miscellaneous commands contain number of convenient utilities. For example, you can generate the
                    project stub for Scala and SBT using the following command:
