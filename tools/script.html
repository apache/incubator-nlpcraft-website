            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script that is a <b>central management utility</b> for NLPCraft. Most
            of the functions this script does can be done through running
            Java applications - yet, using this script, you can accomplish the same things much simpler and quicker.
            From starting and managing REST server, running various tools, to testing models via REST API -
            <code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code> script provides a single centralized utility that makes a quick work out
            of all these routine tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The script is only available in either official Apache <a href="/download.html#src">source ZIP</a> or in
            <a href="/download.html#zip">binary ZIP</a> distributions. If you used Maven or similar build tools to
            add NLPCraft to your project, this script will not available automatically - you will need to download ZIP
            distribution separately.
        </p>
