            Synonym suggester tool takes an existing model, analyses its synonyms and intents and comes up with
            a list of synonyms that are currently missing that you might want to add to your model.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is accessed via REST call. It is based on Google's BERT and Facebook fasttext
            models. It requires <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCIntentSample.html">@NCIntentSample</a> annotations present on intent
            callbacks. When invoked, the tool scans the given data model for intents and their
            <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCIntentSample.html">@NCIntentSample</a> annotations, and based on these samples tries to determine
            which synonyms are missing in the model.

        <p>
            In order to use this tool the <code>ctxword</code> server should be started and the server's configuration
            should be updated.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-sub-title"><code>ctxword</code> Server</h3>
        <p>
            'ctxword' server is a Python-based module that provides BERT and fasttext based implementation
            for finding a contextually related words for a given word from the input sentence. NLPCraft server interacts
            with 'ctxword' server via internal REST interface. To configure NLPCraft server and start 'ctxword' Python-based
            server follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Install necessary dependencies. <b>This step should only be performed once:</b>
                <nav>
                    <div class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
                        <a class="nav-item nav-link active" data-toggle="tab" href="#nav-nix" role="tab" aria-controls="nav-home" aria-selected="true">Linux/Unix/MacOS</a>
                        <a class="nav-item nav-link" data-toggle="tab" href="#nav-win" role="tab" aria-controls="nav-home" aria-selected="true">Windows</a>
                    </div>
                </nav>
                <div class="tab-content">
                    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="nav-nix" role="tabpanel">
                        <p>
                            Run the following command from NLPCraft installation directory:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="brush: plain">
                            $ src/main/python/ctxword/bin/install_dependencies.sh
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="nav-win" role="tabpanel">
                        <pre class="brush: plain">
                            Read 'src\main\python\ctxword\bin\WINDOWS_SETUP.md' file for manual installation instructions.
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Optional.</em>
                <br/>
                Configure <code>nlpcraft.server.ctxword.url</code> property in <code>nlpcraft.conf</code> file (or your own configuration file).
                This property comes with a default endpoint and you only need to change it if you change the
                'ctxword' module implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the 'ctxword' server by running the following command from NLPCraft installation directory:
                <pre class="brush: plain">
                    src/main/python/ctxword/bin/start_server.{sh|cmd}
                </pre>
                <div class="bq info">
                    <p>
                        <b>1st Start</b>
                    </p>
                    Note that on the first start the server will try to load compressed BERT model which is not yet
                    available. It will then download this library and compress it which will take a several minutes
                    and may require 10 GB+ of available memory. Subsequent starts will skip this step, and the
                    server will start much faster.
