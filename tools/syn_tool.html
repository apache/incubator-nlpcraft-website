        <p>
            Synonym suggester tool takes an existing model, analyses its synonyms and intents and comes up with
            a list of synonyms that are currently missing that you might want to add to your model.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is accessed via REST call. It is based on Google's BERT and Facebook fasttext
            models. It requires <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCIntentSample.html">@NCIntentSample</a> annotations present on intent
            callbacks. When invoked, the tool scans the given data model for intents and their
            <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCIntentSample.html">@NCIntentSample</a> annotations, and based on these samples tries to determine
            which synonyms are missing in the model.

        <h2 class="section-title">Usage</h2>
        <p>
            In order to use this tool the <code>ctxword</code> server and NLPCraft server should be started as well as
            the server's configuration should potentially be updated.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-sub-title"><code>ctxword</code> Server</h3>

            <b>Python 3.6-3.8</b>
            <p>
                As of this writing (Dec 2020) the <code>ctxword</code> server and its dependencies work only with Python 3.6-3.8 version.

            'ctxword' server is a Python-based module that provides BERT and fasttext based implementation
            for finding a contextually related words for a given word from the input sentence. NLPCraft server interacts
            with 'ctxword' server via internal REST interface. To configure NLPCraft server and start 'ctxword' Python-based
            server follow these steps:

            <li>
                <p>
                    Install necessary dependencies by running the following commands from the NLPCraft installation
                    directory:<br/>
                    <b>NOTE:</b> this step should only be performed once.

            The result is structured as a list of proposed synonyms with their corresponding scores for each model's
            element.
            You should analyse the results for their fitness for your model and its existing synonyms. The tool cannot guarantee
            that every suggested synonym is appropriate or valid - but it gives a good "courtesy" check for potentially
            missing synonyms.

                It is a good idea to run this tool periodically if you are actively changing the model. With dozens or hundreds
                of model elements it is very hard to manually maintain quality set of synonyms. With a good list of
