            Synonym suggester tool takes an existing model, analyses its synonyms and intents and comes up with
            a list of synonyms that are currently missing that you might want to add to your model.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is accessed via REST call. It's implementation is based on Google's BERT and Facebook fasttext
            models. It requires <a target="javadoc" href=/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCIntentSample.html">@NCIntentSample</a> annotations present on intent
            callbacks. In short, the tool scans the data model for intents and their
            <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCIntentSample.html">@NCIntentSample</a> annotations, and based on these samples tries to determine
            which synonyms are missing in the model.
