        <p>
            When using NLPCraft to develop natural language interface to the existing SQL RDBMS one of the
            routine tasks is to develop a data model that mirrors the SQL schema for the given
            database. Doing it manually can be time consuming and error prone...
        </p>
        <p>
            SQL model generator automates this task. This is a Java-based utility that takes JDBC configuration,
            reads database schema using it and creates initial JSON or YAML stub for the data model. This stub then
            can be used as is or be extended further.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Usage</h2>
        <p>
            This utility is highly configurable. It take several parameters like JDBC URL and driver, database schema,
            optional set of tables and columns to include or exclude for which it will generate YAML/JSON NLPCraft
            model stub. Run this utility with <code>--help</code> parameter to get a full up-to-date documentation:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
java -cp apache-nlpcraft-incubating-{{site.latest_version}}-all-deps.jar org.apache.nlpcraft.model.tools.sqlgen.NCSqlModelGenerator --help
        </pre>
        <p>
            NOTE: this utility is Java-based and can be run similarly from command line or any IDE.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time of this writing (NLPCraft ver. 0.5.0) this would produce the following output:

NAME:
    NCSqlModelGenerator -- NLPCraft model generator for SQL databases.

SYNOPSIS:
    java -cp apache-nlpcraft-incubating-0.5.0-all-deps.jar org.apache.nlpcraft.model.tools.sqlgen.NCSqlModelGenerator [PARAMETERS]

DESCRIPTION:
    This utility generates NLPCraft model stub for a given SQL database schema. You
    can choose database schema, set of tables and columns for which you
    want to generate NLPCraft model. After the model is generated you can
    further configure and customize it for your specific needs.

    This Java class can be run from the command line or from an IDE like any other
    Java application. Note that required JDBC driver class must be available on the
    classpath and therefore its JAR should be added to the classpath when running
    this application.

PARAMETERS:
    [--url|-r] url
        Mandatory database JDBC URL.

    [--driver|-d] class
        Mandatory JDBC driver class. Note that 'class' must be a
        fully qualified class name. It should also be available on
        the classpath.

    [--schema|-s] schema
        Mandatory database schema to scan.

    [--out|-o] filename
        Mandatory name of the output JSON or YAML model file. It should
        have one of the following extensions: .js, .json, .yml, or .yaml
        File extension determines the output file format.

    [--user|-u] username
        Optional database user name.

    [--password|-w] password
        Optional database user password.

    [--model-id|-x] id
        Optional generated model ID. By default, the model ID will be 'sql.model.id'.

    [--model-ver|-v] version
        Optional generated model version. By default, the model ID will be '1.0.0-timestamp'.

    [--model-name|-n] name
        Optional generated model name. By default, the model name will be 'SQL-based model'.

    [--exclude|-e] list
        Optional semicolon-separate list of tables and/or columns to exclude. By
        default, none of the tables and columns in the schema are excluded. See below
        for more information.

    [--prefix|-f] list
        Optional comma-separate list of table or column name prefixes to remove.
        These prefixes will be removed when name is used for model elements
        synonyms. By default, no prefixes will be removed.

    [--suffix|-q] list
        Optional comma-separate list of table or column name suffixes to remove.
        These suffixes will be removed when name is used for model elements
        synonyms. By default, no suffixes will be removed.

    [--include|-i] list
        Optional semicolon-separate list of tables and/or columns to include. By
        default, all tables and columns in the schema are included. See below
        for more information.

    [--synonyms|-y] [true|false]
        Optional flag on whether or not to generated auto synonyms for the model elements.
        Default is true.

    [--override|-z] [true|false]
        Flag to determine whether or not to override output file if it already exist.
        If override is disabled (default) and output file exists - a unique file name will
        be used instead.
        Default is false.

    [--parent|-p] [true|false]
        Optional flag on whether or not to use element's parent relationship for
        defining SQL columns and their containing (i.e. parent) tables.
        Default is false.

    [--help|-h|-?]
        Prints this usage information.

DETAILS:
    -r, -d, -s, and -o are mandatory parameters, everything else is optional.

    Each -i or -e parameter is a semicolon ';' separated  list of table or columns names.
    Each table or column name can be one of following forms:
      - table         -- to filter on table names only.
      - table#column  -- to filter on both table and column names.
      - #column       -- to filter on columns only (regardless of the table).

    Table and column names are treated as standard Java regular expressions. Note that
    both '#' and ';' cannot be used inside of the regular expression:

    -e "#_.+"             -- excludes any columns starting with '_'.
    -e "tmp.+"            -- excludes all tables starting with 'tmp'.
    -i "Order.*;#[^_].+"  -- includes only tables starting with 'Order' and columns that
                             do not start with '_'.

EXAMPLES:
    java -cp apache-nlpcraft-incubating-0.5.0-all-deps.jar org.apache.nlpcraft.model.tools.sqlgen.NCSqlModelGenerator
        -r jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
        -d org.postgresql.Driver
        -f "tbl_, col_"
        -q "_tmp, _old, _unused"
        -s public
        -e "#_.+"
        -o model.json
        </pre>
        <p>
            After the data model stub is generated:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Load generated YAML/JSON-based model using <a target="javadoc" href="https://javadoc.io/static/org.apache.nlpcraft/nlpcraft/0.5.0/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/NCModelFileAdapter.html">NCModelFileAdapter</a>
                class to instantiate model from this file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modify and extend generated model stub to your own needs. In most cases, you'll need
                to add, remove or modify auto-generated synonyms, add intents, etc. Note, however, that generated model
                is valid and minimally complete and can be used as is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/tools/sqlgen/NCSqlExtractorBuilder.html">NCSqlSchemaBuilder</a> class to get an object representation of the
                SQL data schema for the model. You can use this object representation along with many utility
                methods in <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/model/tools/sqlgen/NCSqlExtractor.html">NCSqlExtractor</a>
                class to efficiently auto-generate SQL queries against the source RDBMS.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            SQL model generator comes with a several utility classes that can be used to programmatically explore
            generated data model, its elements and their metadata. You should start with the following builders to learn more
            about these utility classes:

            SQL model generator is used by <a target="github" href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-nlpcraft/tree/master/nlpcraft/src/main/scala/org/apache/nlpcraft/examples/sql">SQL Model</a> example. This example comes with two YAML models:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>sql_model_init.yaml</code> - original generated model straight out of the SQL model generator.</li>
            <li><code>sql_model.yaml</code> - modified and updated model ultimately used by the example.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is recommended to run a diff between these two files to see what was actually changed and how.
