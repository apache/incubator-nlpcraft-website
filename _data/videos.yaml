    This is the recording of the presentation from ApacheCon Asia 2021 conference.
    This presentation is split into two parts. In the first 20 minutes we will be talking
    about what NLPCraft is and is not, what are some of its unique ideas, how it works at a high level,
    and how it is different from many existing approaches. In the second part, we will do a full live coding
    demonstration where we will build a fully functional application that would have a natural language interface to it.
