        <p>
            This example demonstrates a relatively complete implementation of natural language interface to a
            SQL database. This is a non-trivial example, spanning over a  thousand lines of code, and it can
            act as a basis for production-ready implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that a significant part of the implementation is not directly related to NLPCraft but rather deals
            with SQL statement construction. We specifically decided not to use any 3rd party libraries for it to
            show what can be done "from scratch".

        <p>
            Many of modern existing natural language-to-SQL implementations use variations of
            deep learning approach where you first train the neural network on a pre-created training set and
            then get to use the trained network to provide (infer) probabilistic answers for the new input sentences. Although the latest
            natural language-to-SQL attempts to implement this approach are getting into 90% percentile of accuracy - they remain largely
            unusable for the vast swath of enterprise applications where non-deterministic nature of such systems
            renders them practically useless. The apparent problem with non-deterministic systems like that is that the user
            never knows whether a given answer is correct or incorrect. In these use cases users can't tolerate the fact that
            in 5-10% of the cases the answer will be invalid. Try that for your HR or revenue reporting system,
            prescriptive analytics systems, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note, however, that for many non-mission-critical systems such non-determinism does
            not pose a significant problem. We happily accept such imprecision when asking for direction on our
            mobile devices, unlock our phones using face or fingerprint recognition, when performing sentiment
            analysis or trying to detect faces of our friends across thousands of photographs. Cost of retries,
            as well as the cost of initial errors, is insignificant in these cases. The same cost, however, in many business
            applications can be too significant to tolerate.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you may have learned by now, NLPCraft uses a <i>fully deterministic approach</i> in an attempt to
            match the user input against a defined set of intents. If it finds the matching intent - it guarantees that
            match for a given intent. If no matching intent can be found - it returns the negative
            result without any ambiguity. In other words, if the answer is given, it is deterministically guaranteed to be correct.
            Another positive side-effect of this approach is the fact that such matching logic is traceable, i.e.
            the user can see why given user input was matched against a certain intent (and not any other). Such
            traceability of the comprehension logic (or explainability vs "black box" approach from deep
            learning techniques) is often critical for many real-life business applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the flip side, one of the downsides of such an approach in general is the need to have a detailed,
            domain-specific model
            for each SQL database (when dealing with SQL databases). Building such a
            model can be a non-trivial and time consuming experience. That is where NLPCraft brings a lot of built-in tooling
            to simplify this task dramatically.

            from <a target="_" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases#get-the-northwind-sample-database-for-sql-server">Microsoft SQL Server</a>:

        <p>
            You can find SQL script creating this database and populating it with the sample data at

            In our example we are using H2 database instance. For convenience, example provides a command line application

            that automatically starts local H2 database instance with default configuration (localhost on port 9092) and initializes it
            using <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-nlpcraft/blob/master/nlpcraft-examples/sql/src/main/resources/northwind.sql" target="github"><code>db/northwind.sql</code></a> script.

        <p>
            Creating data model manually for the existing SQL schema can be a daunting task. NLPCraft provides the tool
            that can scan SQL schema and create working stub of such model automatically. All you have to do then is to
            add any necessary modifications to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="/tools/sql_model_gen.html">SQL Model Generation</a> is a Java-based utility that takes
            JDBC configuration, reads database schema using it and creates initial JSON or YAML stub for the
            data model. This stub then can be used as is or be extended further.
