            REST API provides a universal integration path for any type of user application to connect to and use NLPCraft.
            By using REST API these applications can ask natural language questions, get results and perform
            many supporting operations such as user management.
        </p>
        <p>
            REST server accepts the REST call,
            interprets and routes it to the appropriate data probe which in turn invokes one of its deployed
            data models. The result of data model processing travels all the way through the same chain of components
            back to the user application that made the original call.

            NLPCraft provide native Java client that enables easy-to-use Java-based API wrapping standard
            NLPCraft REST APIs. It can be used by any JVM language that provides Java interop such as Scala, Groovy, or Kotlin:

        <h2 class="section-title">REST URL <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            REST API accepts only <code>POST</code> HTTP calls and <code>application/json</code> content type
            for JSON payload and responses. When issuing a REST call you will be using the following URL:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            https://localhost:8081/api/v1/signin
        </pre>
        <p>
        where:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>http</code></dt>
                <dd>Either <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> protocol.</dd>
            <dt><code>localhost:8081</code></dt>
                <dd>Host and port on which REST server is started. <code>localhost:8081</code> is the default configuration and can be <a href="/server-and-probe.html">changed</a>.</dd>
            <dt><code>/api/v1</code></dt>
                <dd>Mandatory prefix indicating API version.</dd>
            <dt><code>/signin</code></dt>
                <dd>Specific REST path.</dd>

                <b>Management Script</b>

            <p>
                <a href="/tools/script.html"><code>bin/nlpcraft.{sh|cmd}</code></a> script is a <b>central management utility</b> for NLPCraft. Among many
                commands it provides, there are two commands <code>call</code> and <code>rest</code> that allows for simple and
                effective REST API usage against local REST server.

        <h2 class="section-title">Users <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Organizations <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            In NLPCraft most of the REST calls require ID of the user. Every user belongs to a company, and each user
            has administrative privileges flag. The notion of the user and company IDs additionally to the model ID provide
            necessary attributes for proper probe authentication, conversation maintenance, and security.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Default Account <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            NLPCraft comes with the default account:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Email: </b>admin@admin.com</li>
            <li><b>Password: </b>admin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This account has administrative privileges and should be used as a bootstrap account to create other accounts.
            Make sure to delete this account when you go to production.
        </p>
        <div class="bq warn">
            <p><b><span style="font-size: 120%; color: #E67E22">âš </span> Default Account <span style="font-size: 120%; color: #E67E22">âš </span></b></p>
            <p>
                Make sure to delete the default account when you go to production or as soon as you have other secure
                administrative account that can act as a bootstrap account.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">Admins <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            Many operations are only available to the users with administrative privileges. Note
            also that some operations will implicitly behave differently based on whether the currently signed in user
            have administrative privileges or not.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-sub-title">External User ID <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            Many calls on REST API accept external "on-behalf-of" user ID (<code>usrExtId</code>) additionally to the regular
            user ID (<code>usrID</code>). In these methods zero, one or both IDs must be provided. If none are provided
            the ID of the currently signed in user will be used. If both are provided they should point to the same user.
            External user ID allows to use user identification from the external systems without a need to import all the
            existing users into NLPCraft in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typical usage pattern for integrating NLPCraft into existing
            system is to create a single administrative NLPCraft user, sign in with that account and then use external
            "on-behalf-of" user IDs in all the requests. This way you get the same functionality as if using ordinary
            user IDs but without a need to migrate and synchronize all user accounts from the existing system to NLPCraft.

        <h2 class="section-title">Server Errors <a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            When REST server returns HTTP error the response body contains JSON object (<code>Content-Type â†’ application/json</code>)
            with two fields <code>code</code> and <code>msg</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: js">
        {
            "code": "NC_INVALID_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "msg": "Unknown access token: PPdxjwXBOIMpAWNgpKq1"
        }
        </pre>
        <p>
            Following tables shows all possible <code>code</code> values for these server errors:
        </p>
        <table class="gradient-table">
            <thead>
            <tr>

                <td>
                    The access token is invalid or no longer valid. Note that previously issued existing access
                    tokens can expire or be otherwise invalidated and have to be obtained again.

                <td>
                    Invalid or unknown user email and/or user password during <code>/signin</code> call. This can
                    indicate either the attempt to signin by the user that hasn't been added yet, or the invalid
                    password for the existing user.

                    See <code>msg</code> field in the error response for details.
                </td>

                    is returned when you attempt to remove or revoke admin privileges from the
                    last admin user.
