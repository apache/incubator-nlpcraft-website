        <p>
            NLPCraft library is based on two main concepts <code>Data Model</code> and <code>Client</code>
            which have API representations
            <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCModel.html">NCModel</a> and
            <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCModelClient.html">NCModelClient</a>.
            For work with the system you should prepare <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCModel.html">NCModel</a> instance
            which is based on configuration and list of components named <code>pipeline</code>.
            After you just communicate with prepared model via client's methods.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Data Model</code> is domain specific object which responsible for user input interpretation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Client</code> is object which allows to communicate with the given data model.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Typical part of code:</p>

        <pre class="brush: scala, highlight: []">
              // Initialized prepared domain model.
              val mdl = new CustomNlpModel()

              // Creates client for given model.
              val client = new NCModelClient(mdl)

              // Sends text request to model by user ID "userId".
              val result = client.ask("Some user command", "userId")

              // Clears dialog session for user with ID "userId".
              client.clearDialog("userId")
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="model">
        <h2 class="section-title">Data Model responsibility<a href="#"><i class="top-link fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-up"></i></a></h2>
        <p>
            Let's start with terminology and describe the system work workflow.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Token</code> represented as <a  href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCToken.html">NCToken</a>.
                It is simple string, part of user input, which split according to some rules,
                for instance by spaces and some additional conditions, which depends on language and some expectations.
                So user input "<b>Where is it?</b>" contains four tokens:
                "<code>Where</code>", "<code>is</code>", "<code>it</code>", "<code>?</code>".
                Usually <code>tokens</code> are words and punctuation symbols which can also contain some additional
                information like point of speech etc.
                <code>Tokens</code> are input for searching the <code>entities</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Entity</code> represented as <a  href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCEntity.html">NCEntity</a>.
                According to wikipedia, named entity is a real-world object, such as a person, location, organization,
                product, etc., that can be denoted with a proper name. It can be abstract or have a physical existence.
                Each <code>entity</code> can contain one or more tokens.
                <code>Entities</code> are input for searching <code>intents</code> according to <a href="intent-matching.html">Intent matching</a> conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Variant</code> represented as <a  href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCVariant.html">NCVariant</a>.
                It is a list of <code>entities</code>. Potentially, each <code>token</code> can be recognized as
                different <code>entities</code>,
                so user input can be processed as set of <code>variants</code>.
                For example user input "Mercedes" can be processed as two <code>variants</code>,
                both of them contains single element list of <code>entities</code>: <b>car brand</b> or <b>Spanish female name</b>.
                When words are not overlapped with different <code>entities</code> there is only one
                <code>variant</code> detected.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Intent</code> is user defined callback and rule, according to which this callback should be called.
                Rule is most often some template, based on expected set of <code>entities</code> in user input,
                but it can be more flexible.
                Parameters extracted from user text input are passed into callback methods.
                These methods execution results are provided to user as answer on his request.
                <code>Intent</code> callbacks are methods defined in <code>Data Model</code> class annotated by
                <code>intent</code> rules via <a href="intent-matching.html">IDL</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <code>Data Model</code> must be able to do tree following things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Parse user input text as the <code>tokens</code>.
                They are input for searching <code>named entities</code>.
                <code>Tokens</code> parsing components should be included into <a href="#model-pipeline">Model pipeline</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find <code>named entities</code> based on these parsed <code>tokens</code>.
                They are input for searching <code>intents</code>.
                <code>Entity</code> parsing components should be included into <a href="#model-pipeline">Model pipeline</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare <code>intents</code> with their callbacks methods which contain business logic.
                These methods should be defined directly in the model class definition or the model should have references on them.
                It will be described below.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As example, let's prepare the system which can call persons from your contact list.
            Typical commands are: "<b>Please call to John Smith</b>" or "<b>Connect me with Barbara Dillan</b>".
            For solving this task this model should be able to recognize in user text following entities:
            <code>command</code> and <code>person</code> to apply this command.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, when request "<b>Please call to John Smith</b>" received, our model should be able to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Parse tokens splitting user text input:
                "<code>please</code>", "<code>call</code>", "<code>to</code>", "<code>john</code>", "<code>smith</code>".
            </li>
            <li>
                Find two named entities:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>command</code> by token "<code>call</code>".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>person</code> by tokens "<code>john</code>" and "<code>smith</code>".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Have prepared intent:
                <pre class="brush: scala, highlight: [1, 2, 5, 6]">
                    @NCIntent("intent=call term(command)={# == command'} term(person)={# == 'person'}")
                    def onCommand(
                        ctx: NCContext,
                        im: NCIntentMatch,
                        @NCIntentTerm("command") command: NCEntity,
                        @NCIntentTerm("person") person: NCEntity
                    ): NCResult = ? // Implement business logic here.
                </pre>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>Line 1</code> defines intent <code>call</code> with two conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Line 2</code> defines related callback method <code>onCommand()</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Lines 4 and 5</code> define two callback method's arguments which are corresponded to
                        <code>call</code> intent terms conditions. You can extract normalized value
                        <code>john smith</code> from the <code>person</code> parameter and use it in the method body
                        for getting his phone number etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Note that there are a lot of options of defining intents and their callback methods.
                    They can be defined in configuration files, nested classes, etc.
                    Look at the chapter <a href="intent-matching.html">Intent Matching</a> content for get more details.

            Client which is represented as <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCModelClient.html">NCModelClient</a>
            is necessary for communication with the model. Base client methods  are described below.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>ask()</code> passes user text input to the model and receives back execution
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCResult.html">NCResult</a> or
                rejection exception if there isn't any triggered intents.
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCResult.html">NCResult</a> is wrapper on
                callback method execution result with additional information.

            <li>
                <code>debugAsk()</code> passes user text input to the model and receives back callback and its parameters or
                rejection exception if there isn't any triggered intents.
                Main difference from <code>ask</code> that triggered intent callback method is not called.
                This method and this parameter can be useful for tests scenarios.
