        Most of the NLP tasks start with the basic challenge - how to find or detect something in the text. Whether
        you are designing a search engine, conversational interface or some sort of classificator you will likely
        start with a problem of how to detect <a target="_new" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Named_entity">named entities</a>
        in the input text. These named entities can be universal
        such as dates, countries, cities as well as domain specific for your model. It is also important to note that
        we are talking about a class of NLP tasks where you actually know what you are looking for.

    </figure>
    <p>
        The software component responsible for finding the named entities is called a named entity recognition
        (NER) component. Its goal is to find a certain entity in the input text and optionally extract additional
        information about this entity. For example, consider the sentence "Give me <b>twenty two</b> face masks". A numeric
        NER component will find numeric entity “twenty two” and will extract normalized integer value “22” from it
        which can be then used further.
    </p>
    <p>
        NER components are usually based on neural networks that are trained on extensive and well prepared models
        (corpus) as well as on simpler rule-based or synonym matching algorithms that are better suited for domain
        specific applications. Note that most universal NER components tend to use some variation of neural networks
        based algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rest of this blog will concentrate on a brief review of existing popular products and open source projects
        that provide NER components. We will also look at what Apache NLPCraft project brings to the table on this
        topic as well. Note that this review is far from exhaustive analysis of these libraries but rather a quick
        overview of their pros and cons as of the end of 2020.

    <h2 class="section-title">NER Providers</h2>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at several well-known NLP libraries that provide built-in NER components.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-sub-title">Apache OpenNLP</h3>
    <p>
        <img class="img-title" src="/images/opennlp-logo.png" height="48px" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://opennlp.apache.org/">Apache OpenNlp</a> is an Apache licensed open source library that provides a typical set of built-in NER
        components for English to detect dates, times, geographic locations, organizations, numeric values,
        and known persons. Other languages such as Spanish and Dutch are supported with some limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apache OpenNLP is a Java library and its models are available separately due to ASF
        release process limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pros:</b><br/>
        Apache license, mature and well tested implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cons:</b><br/>
        Built-in models don’t see much of the development, if any at all, in the last several years.
        It appears that the main usage pattern of Apache OpenNLP is to build and train your own models from scratch.
