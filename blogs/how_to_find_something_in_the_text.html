    <p>
        Most of the NLP tasks start with the basic challenge - how to find or detect something in the text. Whether
        you are designing a search engine, conversational interface or some sort of classificator you will likely
        start with a problem of how to detect <a target="_new" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Named_entity">named entities</a>
        in the input text. These named entities can be universal
        such as dates, countries, cities as well as domain specific for your model. It is also important to note that
        we are talking about a class of NLP tasks where you actually know what you are looking for.

        <figcaption><b>Fig 1.</b> Named Entities</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The software component responsible for finding the named entities is called a named entity recognition
        (NER) component. Its goal is to find a certain entity in the input text and optionally extract additional
        information about this entity. For example, consider the sentence "Give me <b>twenty two</b> face masks". A numeric
        NER component will find numeric entity “twenty two” and will extract normalized integer value “22” from it
        which can be then used further.
    </p>
    <p>
        NER components are usually based on neural networks that are trained on extensive and well prepared models
        (corpus) as well as on simpler rule-based or synonym matching algorithms that are better suited for domain
        specific applications. Note that most universal NER components tend to use some variation of neural networks
        based algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rest of this blog will concentrate on a brief review of existing popular products and open source projects
        that provide NER components. We will also look at what Apache NLPCraft project brings to the table on this
        topic as well. Note that this review is far from exhaustive analysis of these libraries but rather a quick
        overview of their pros and cons as of the end of 2020.

    <h2 class="section-title">NER Providers</h2>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at several well-known NLP libraries that provide built-in NER components.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-sub-title">Apache OpenNLP</h3>
    <p>
        <img class="img-title" src="/images/opennlp-logo.png" height="48px" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://opennlp.apache.org/">Apache OpenNlp</a> is an Apache licensed open source library that provides a typical set of built-in NER
        components for English to detect dates, times, geographic locations, organizations, numeric values,
        and known persons. Other languages such as Spanish and Dutch are supported with some limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apache OpenNLP is a Java library and its models are available separately due to ASF
        release process limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pros:</b><br/>
        Apache license, mature and well tested implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cons:</b><br/>
        Built-in models don’t see much of the development, if any at all, in the last several years.
        It appears that the main usage pattern of Apache OpenNLP is to build and train your own models from scratch.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-sub-title">Stanford NLP</h3>
    <p>
        <img class="img-title" src="/images/corenlp-logo.png" height="64px" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
        <a target="_parent" href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP</a> is a popular and actively developed, mature NLP library that provides a wide range of
        functionality. For English it supports the following named entities: person, location, organization,
        misc, money, number, ordinal, percent, date, time, duration, set. Furthermore, built in regular expressions
        based NER component allows to recognize the following additional named entities: email, url, city,
        state_or_province, country, nationality, religion, (job) title, ideology, criminal_charge, cause_of_death,
        handle. More information <a target="_blank" href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ner.html#description">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        There’s a limited support for German, Spanish and Mandarin languages. <a target="_blank" href="https://corenlp.run/">Live demo</a> allows you to test out
        various capabilities of Stanford NLP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stanford NLP is a Java library. Models are available in Maven along with the project itself.
        I could not find a detailed description of NER components for languages other than English. <a target=_blank href="https://medium.com/sicara/train-ner-model-with-nltk-stanford-tagger-english-french-german-6d90573a9486">Here</a>
        and <a target=_blank href="https://medium.com/@klintcho/training-a-swedish-ner-model-for-stanford-corenlp-part-2-20a0cfd801dd#.vnow3swam">here</a> you can find instructions on how to train your own NER components for other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pros:</b><br/>
        Maturity of the project. Live and actively developed project with very good recognition quality
        (I use the word “good” very subjectively as we won’t go into formal qualitative metrics of each
        project here).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cons:</b><br/>
        The biggest gripe is the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/ru/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU GPL</a> license which is all but shun away these days due its viral
        nature and business unfriendliness. In other words - it is not free and you have to buy a commercial
        license if you intend to use it in any serious way. Documentation is adequate at best and can be a
        frustrating experience (just like most other academically driven software projects).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-sub-title">Google Language API</h3>
    <img class="img-title" src="/images/google-cloud-logo-small.png" height="56px" alt="">
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language">Google Language API</a> supports the
        following named entities for the English language: person, location, organization, event, work_of_art,
        consumer_good, other, phone_number, address, date, number, price.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google Language API is available as REST API with the native client libraries for Java, C#, Python, Go, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pros:</b><br/>
        Large set of NER components from a trusted NLP-based company like Google. Scalability and availability of
        modern SaaS platform developed by Google...
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cons:</b><br/>
        REST API inherently limits the performance of the final solution - making it almost impossible to be used
        in any “real-time” applications. Free only for a small number of transactions, paid after that. Not open source.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-sub-title">spacy</h3>
    <img id="spacy" class="img-title" src="/images/spacy-logo.png" height="48px" alt="">
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a> is a Python library that provides one of the best, if not the best, collection of NER components.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://spacy.io/api/annotation#named-entities">Here</a> you can see a full list of supported NERs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pros:</b><br/>
        Actively developed and mature project. Open source with MIT license. One of the best
        documentation among similar projects. One of the most popular NLP libraries among a few dozens of available
        libraries for the Python community.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cons:</b><br/>
        Python - which is rarely used for production level applications. Slow, often unacceptably slow,
        performance (due to Python as well). Lack of 1st grade support for language other than English.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Additional Capabilities of Apache NLPCraft</h2>
    <p>
        Let’s take a look at what Apache NLPCraft brings different or additionally to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to NER components, Apache NLPCraft provides the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built-in NER components for date, geographical locations, numerics, sorting, limiting, and few others with all of them supporting the extraction of the normalized values and extensive metadata.</li>
        <li>Integration with external NER components from Apache OpenNLP, Stanford NLP, Google Language API and spacy.</li>
        <li>Support for “composable entities” where users can create new detectable named entities out of existing ones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While built-in NER components and integration with 3rd party ones is rather a “pedestrian”
        capabilities (and you can read about them <a href="/integrations.html">here</a>) - the “composable entities” is something that is unique for Apache NLPCraft.
        Let’s look at it in more detail.
