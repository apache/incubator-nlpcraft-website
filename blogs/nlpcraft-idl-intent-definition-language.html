        This blog is an English adaptation of Sergey Kamov's <a target=habr href="https://habr.com/ru/post/559716">blog</a> written in Russian.

    <p>
        This article is a second part of the article <a target=habr href="https://habr.com/ru/post/534034/">Designing intents with Apache NlpCraft</a>
        <img alt="" src="/images/ru-flag-128x128.png" width="24"> and contains a detailed description of
        NLPCraft IDL - Intent Definition Language, created for NLP projects based on the Apache NlpCraft.
        NLPCraft IDL support has been added to the system since version <a href="/download.html">0.7.5</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The declarative Intent Definition Language, called <a href="/intent-matching.html">NLPCraft IDL</a>, significantly simplifies the process of
        working with intents in NLP-based dialog and search systems developed using Apache NLPsCraft and at the same time
        expands the capabilities of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start with examples to demonstrate the general capabilities of the language, provide the necessary explanations,
        and then describe the design of the language a bit more formally.
    </p>
    <div class="bq info">
        Note that at the point of choosing the best matching intent, NLP systems, in general, already have a parsed and processed
        user input request, which contains combinations of requestâ€™s tokens and other related information.
