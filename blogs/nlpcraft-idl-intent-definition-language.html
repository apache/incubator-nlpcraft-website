        This article is a second part of the article <a target=habr href="https://habr.com/ru/post/534034/">Designing intents with Apache NlpCraft</a>
        <img alt="" src="/images/ru-flag-128x128.png" width="24"> and contains a detailed description of
        NLPCraft IDL - Intent Definition Language, created for NLP projects based on the Apache NlpCraft.
        NLPCraft IDL support has been added to the system since version <a href="/download.html">0.7.5</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The declarative Intent Definition Language, called <a href="/intent-matching.html">NLPCraft IDL</a>, significantly simplifies the process of
        working with intents in NLP-based dialog and search systems developed using Apache NLPsCraft and at the same time
        expands the capabilities of them.
    </p>
    <div class="bq success">
        <p>
            Note that at the point of choosing the best matching intent, NLP systems, in general, already have a parsed and processed
            user input request, which contains combinations of requestâ€™s tokens and other related information.

    <p>
        Let's start with examples to demonstrate the general capabilities of the language, provide the necessary explanations,
        and then describe the design of the language a bit more formally.
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: idl">
        intent=xa
           flow="^(?:login)(^:logout)*$"
           meta={'enabled': true}
           term(a)={!(tok_id()) != "z"}[1,3]
           term(b)={
              meta_intent('enabled') == true && // Must be active.
              month() == 1 // January.
           }
           term(c)~{
                // Variables.
                @tokId = tok_id()
                @usrTypes = meta_model('user_types')

                // Predicate.
                (tokId == 'order' || tokId == 'order_cancel') &&
                has_all(@usrTypes, list(1, 2, 3) &&
                abs(meta_tok('order:size')) > 10)
    </pre>
    <p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The intent name is <code>xa</code>.</li>
        <li>
            The intent contains three terms. Term is an element that defines a predicate, each of which must
            pass for the intent to be selected:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>term(a)</code> - the parsed request must contain between one and three tokens with identifiers
                    other than <code>z</code>, without taking into account data from the dialogue history (term type <code>=</code>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>term(b)</code> - the intent must be active - the flag <code>enabled</code> from the model metadata.
                    In addition, such an intent can only be triggered in January - the <code>month()</code> built-in function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>term(c)</code> - the token with identifier <code>order</code> or <code>order_cancel</code> should
                    be found in the request or in the dialogue history (term type <code>~</code>). There are additional
                    restrictions in the model metadata values and also the order size absolute value should be more than 10.
                    In the definition of this term we use IDL variables - and we will talk about them a little bit later.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>flow=</code> This section defines an additional rule, according to which for the intent to
            be triggered, the intent with the <code>login</code> identifier must have been selected at least
            once within the current session, and the intent with the identifier <code>logout</code> should have never
            been selected in this session. The rule is defined as a regular expression based on the intents IDs
            of the previous intents in the user session. Other ways to create similar rules will also be
            described below.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>meta=</code> For the given intent, a certain set of data can be defined - in this case a
            configuration - with which you can enable or disable the intent.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <pre class="brush: idl">
        intent=xb
           flow=/#flowModelMethod/
           ordered=true
           term(a)=/org.mypackage.MyClass#termMethod/?
           fragment(frag)
    </pre>
    <p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The intent name is <code>xb</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>term(a)</code> The intent can contain one optional term (<code>?</code> quantifier,
            detailed explanations will be given below), defined in the code - <code>org.mypackage.MyClass#termMethod</code> method.</li>
        <li>
            <code>fragment(frag)</code> Fragment with identifier <code>frag</code> extends the list of terms of the intent with
            additional terms that are defined elsewhere (in <code>fragment</code> expression). The <code>frag</code> element must
            be defined above in the code, or accessible via import statement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>flow=</code> Flow contains the condition specified in the model code in the method <code>flowModelMethod</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

            Note that this article is only a brief overview of the capabilities of NLPCraft IDL and is not trying to
            be a comprehensive manual. Before starting to work with NLPCraft, it is recommended to study a
            detailed description of the syntax and all the features review of the language in the corresponding sections
            of the <a href="https://nlpcraft.apache.org/intent-matching.html">documentation</a>.
