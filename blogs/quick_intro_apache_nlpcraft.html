    <p>
        In this short article I would like to introduce Apache NLPCraft - an open source library for adding Natural
        Language Interface to any application. The goal of this project from its inception in 2017 was and still is
        unambiguously straightforward - provide an efficient & highly productive API to develop advanced NLP-based
        interfaces for modern applications.
