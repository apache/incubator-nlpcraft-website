        <p>
            NLPCraft project is based on two main concepts <code>Data Model</code> and <code>Client</code>
            which have API representations
            {% scaladoc NCModel NCModel %} and
            {% scaladoc NCModelClient NCModelClient %}.
            For work with the system you should prepare {% scaladoc NCModel NCModel %} instance
            which is based on configuration and list of components named <code>Pipeline</code>.
            After you just communicate with prepared model via client's methods.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Data Model</code> is domain specific object which responsible for user input interpretation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Client</code> is object which allows to communicate with the given data model.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Typical part of code:</p>

        <pre class="brush: scala, highlight: []">
              // Initializes prepared domain model.
              val mdl = new CustomNlpModel()

              // Creates client for given model.
              val client = new NCModelClient(mdl)

              // Sends text request to model by user ID "userId".
              val result = client.ask("Some user command", "userId")

              // Clears dialog session for user with ID "userId".
              client.clearDialog("userId")
        </pre>
    </section>

            Let's start with terminology and describe the system work workflow.
        </p>

                    <code>Token</code> represented as {% scaladoc NCToken NCToken %}
                    is simple string, part of user input, which split according to some rules
                    for instance by spaces and some additional conditions which depend on language and some expectations.
                    So user input "<b>Where is it?</b>" contains four tokens:
                    "<code>Where</code>", "<code>is</code>", "<code>it</code>", "<code>?</code>".
                    Usually <code>tokens</code> are words and punctuation symbols which can also contain some additional
                    information like point of speech etc.
                    <code>Tokens</code> are input for searching the <code>entities</code>.

            <tr>
                <td><code>Entity</code></td>
                <td>
                    According to wikipedia, <code>named entity</code> is a real-world object, such as a person, location, organization,
                    product, etc., that can be denoted with a proper name. It can be abstract or have a physical existence.
                    Each <code>entity</code> can contain one or more tokens.
                    <code>Entities</code> represented as
                    {% scaladoc NCEntity NCEntity %} are input for searching <code>intents</code> according to <a href="intent-matching.html">Intent matching</a> conditions.

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>Variant</code></td>
                <td>
                    <code>Variant</code> represented as {% scaladoc NCVariant NCVariant %}
                    is a list of <code>entities</code>. Potentially, each <code>token</code> can be recognized as
                    different <code>entities</code>,
                    so user input can be processed as set of <code>variants</code>.
                    For example user input "Mercedes" can be processed as two <code>variants</code>,
                    both of them contains single element list of <code>entities</code>: <b>car brand</b> or <b>Spanish female name</b>.
                    When words are not overlapped with different <code>entities</code> there is only one
                    <code>variant</code> detected.
                </td>
            </tr>

            </tbody>

        <p>
            When <code>Variant</code> is prepared, the suitable  <code>Intent</code> is trying to matched with it.
        </p>

        <table class="gradient-table">
            <thead>
            <tr>

                <td>
                    <code>Intent</code> is user defined callback and rule according to which this callback should be called.
                    Rule is most often some template based on expected set of <code>entities</code> in user input,
                    but it can be more flexible.
                    Parameters extracted from user text input are passed into callback methods.
                    These methods execution results are provided to user as answer on his request.
                    <code>Intent</code> callbacks are methods defined in <code>Data Model</code> class annotated by
                    <code>intent</code> rules via <a href="intent-matching.html">IDL</a>.
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td><code>IDL</code></td>
                <td>
                    IDL, Intent Definition Language, is a relatively straightforward declarative language which
                    defines a match between the parsed user input represented as the collection of tokens,
                    and the user-define callback method.
                    IDL intents are bound to their callbacks via Java annotation and can be located
                    in the same Java annotations or placed in model YAML/JSON file as well as in external *.idl files.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>Callback</code></td>
                <td>
                    The user defined code which mapped to the <code>intent</code>.
                    This method is received as its parameters normalized values from user input text according to
                    IDL matched terms.
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            So, <code>Data Model</code> must be able to do tree following things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Parse user input text as the <code>tokens</code>.
                They are input for searching <code>named entities</code>.
                <code>Tokens</code> parsing components should be included into <a href="#model-pipeline">Model pipeline</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find <code>named entities</code> based on these parsed <code>tokens</code>.
                They are input for searching <code>intents</code>.
                <code>Entity</code> parsing components should be included into <a href="#model-pipeline">Model pipeline</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare <code>intents</code> with their callbacks methods which contain business logic.
                These methods should be defined directly in the model class definition or the model should have references on them.
                It will be described below. Callback can de defined in model scala class directly or via references.
                Look at the chapter <a href="intent-matching.html">Intent Matching</a> content for get more details.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As example, let's prepare the system which can call persons from your contact list.
            Typical commands are: "<b>Please call to John Smith</b>" or "<b>Connect me with Barbara Dillan</b>".
            For solving this task this model should be able to recognize in user text following entities:
            <code>command</code> and <code>person</code> to apply this command.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, when request "<b>Please call to John Smith</b>" received, our model should be able to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Parse tokens splitting user text input:
                "<code>please</code>", "<code>call</code>", "<code>to</code>", "<code>john</code>", "<code>smith</code>".
            </li>
            <li>
                Find two named entities:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>command</code> by token "<code>call</code>".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>person</code> by tokens "<code>john</code>" and "<code>smith</code>".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Have prepared intent:
                <pre class="brush: scala, highlight: [1, 2, 5, 6]">
                    @NCIntent("intent=call term(command)={# == 'command'} term(person)={# == 'person'}")
                    def onCommand(
                        ctx: NCContext,
                        im: NCIntentMatch,
                        @NCIntentTerm("command") command: NCEntity,
                        @NCIntentTerm("person") person: NCEntity
                    ): NCResult = ? // Implement business logic here.
                </pre>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>Line 1</code> defines intent <code>call</code> with two conditions
                        which expects two named entities in user input text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Line 2</code> defines related callback method <code>onCommand()</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Lines 4 and 5</code> define two callback method's arguments which are corresponded to
                        <code>call</code> intent terms conditions. You can extract normalized value
                        <code>john smith</code> from the <code>person</code> parameter and use it in the method body
                        for getting his phone number etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
