        <p>
            Model <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCPipeline.html">NCPipeline</a> contains
            chain of components traits which are responsible for sentence processing.
            Some built-in implementations of these traits are described below.
        </p>

        <p>There are two kinds of pipeline components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Following pipeline components have built-in implementations and described in related sections:
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCTokenParser.html">NCTokenParser</a>,
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCTokenEnricher.html">NCTokenEnricher</a>,
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCEntityParser.html">NCEntityParser</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Following pipeline components cannot have build implementation because their logic are depended on concrete user model:

                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCEntityEnricher.html">NCEntityEnricher</a>,
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCEntityValidator.html">NCEntityValidator</a>,
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCEntityMapper.html">NCEntityMapper</a> and
                <a href="apis/latest/org/apache/nlpcraft/NCVariantFilter.html">NCVariantFilter</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
