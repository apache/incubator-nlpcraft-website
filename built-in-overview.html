        <p>
            Model {% scaladoc NCPipeline NCPipeline %} contains
            chain of components traits which are responsible for sentence processing.
            Some built-in implementations of these traits are described below.
        </p>

        <p>There are two kinds of pipeline components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pipeline components which have built-in implementations and can have broad range of uses:
                {% scaladoc NCTokenParser NCTokenParser %},
                {% scaladoc NCTokenEnricher NCTokenEnricher %},
                {% scaladoc NCEntityParser NCEntityParser %}.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pipeline components which can't have built-in implementations because their logic are depended on concrete user model:
                {% scaladoc NCTokenValidator NCTokenValidator %},
                {% scaladoc NCEntityEnricher NCEntityEnricher %},
                {% scaladoc NCEntityValidator NCEntityValidator %},
                {% scaladoc NCEntityMapper NCEntityMapper %} and
                {% scaladoc NCVariantFilter NCVariantFilter %}.
            </li>
        </ul>
